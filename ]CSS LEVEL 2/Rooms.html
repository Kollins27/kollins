                  <h3>Stay</h3>
                    The Royal is housed in two neighbouring buildings:
                    The Hotel, our classic accommodations exuding warmth 
                    and sensuality, and The Annex, which has roomy,
                    Scandi-inspired studios designed for extended stays.
                    We have 43 guest rooms, including adjacent suites
                    perfectly suited for gathering families or 
                    groups of friends, as well as a peaceful library,
                    a swimming pool and a private terrace reserved
                    exclusively for our overnight guests.
